# Double-Crossed
2 x Vactrol Crossfader in Eurorack format

Two delicious vactrol based crossfaders inspired by Mark Verbos and Don Buchla. 

The top crossfader (crossfader A) is DC coupled and thus optimal for crossfading CV signales to create complex cv signals. 

The bottom crossfader (crossfader B) is AC coupled and thus optimal for audio signals, eg. crossfading between two waveforms, sequences or samples. 

If a signal is patched into the cv input of crossfader A, but nothing is patched into the cv input of crossfader B, the signal at crossfader A's input is automatically sent to crossfader B's cv input.
